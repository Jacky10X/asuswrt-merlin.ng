### What is this repo for?
This repo hosts the code and builds of Asus Merlin for the ASUS DSL-AC68U

### Why?
Asus DSL-AC68U is not officially supported by Asus Merlin; So this is my attempt to make happy people having this router and willing to run the great Merlin custom firmware on it.

### Any chance to get official Merlin support?
No

### Where can I find the firmware to flash on my router?
Here you can find the [latest release](https://github.com/gnuton/asuswrt-merlin.ng/releases/latest) 

### How can I flash this firmware on my DSL-AC68U?
Download the [latest firmware](https://github.com/gnuton/asuswrt-merlin.ng/releases/latest) from the relase page then browse your router web page and upload it from there.

### Where can I find the code for the DSL-AC68U?
Please have a look at the dsl-ac68u branch, which is based on the Merlin's  mainline branch.

### Can you please add/unlock this X feature?
The Merlin firmware is popular for its quality and stability and not for thoudands of features. In any case for fun I can release some snapshots with unlocked features. Here below you can find the current ones:
* REPEATER MODE - status: experimental, it works for me, but still a bit rough around the edges

### Where can I get support for this build
You can use gitter or [SMBForum](https://www.snbforums.com/threads/asuswrt-merlin-builds-for-dsl-routers.55985/).

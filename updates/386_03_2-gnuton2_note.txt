##  GNUton's Asus Merlin changelog  ##

Date: September 18, 2021
Release: 386.03_2-gnuton2

  - NOTE: closed down the Issue tracker on Github, as 90%
          of it was people asking for technical support,
          or failing to use the supplied submission form.
  - NOTE: From now on DSL-AC68U trx images without DSL modem 
          firmware will be provided at each release.
	  Reason: Some ISPs may require older DSL modem fw.
  - CHANGED: Re-disabled jitterentropy-rngd on non-HND
             models.  It kept using CPU time every two
             seconds and had a very marginal impact on
             the entropy pool (which it never could push
             above the target threshold of 1024).
  - CHANGED: Moved the "Redirect Internet traffic" setting on
             the OpenVPN Client page to the Network Settings
             section to increase its visibility, as too many
             users are forgetting to configure it.
  - CHANGED: Display "Internet traffic not redirected" instead
             of "Public IP Unknown" on the OpenVPN Client
             status display when Redirect Internet traffic
             is set to "No".
  - FIXED: Only the first OpenVPN client would be used if
           you had multiple clients connected and the first
           one had a Redirect Internet set to "No".  Now,
           setting this to "No" means that client's routing
           table will no longer get a default gateway
           configured, allowing traffic to be processed
           by other RPDB tables if there wasn't a matching
           route within that client's table.
  - FIXED: IPV6-compatible DNSFilter servers weren't
           properly configured in dnsmasq.
  - FIXED: DNSFilter client rules may get corrupted after a
           reboot.
  - FIXED: Cake QoS for DSL-AX82U now works
  - FIXED: QoS upload classification page now shows upload plot for DSL-AX82U
  - FIXED: WiFi Insight page under wireless tab has been enabled for DSL-AX82U
  - FIXED: DNSFilter has been enabled for DSL-AX82U
  - CHANGED: Enabled ROG and Open NAT for DSL-AC68U
